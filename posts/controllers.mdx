Controllers are responsible for handling incoming **requests** and returning **responses** to the client.

A controller's purpose is to **receive** specific requests and transfer it to the associated endpoint which will send the respons to the client. The [routes object](/documentation/routing) decides which controller receives which requests. Frequently, each controller has **more than one** route, and different routes can perform different actions.

BridgeTS uses **class controllers**. Each controller created has to extend the `Controller` class from `bridgets`.

## Most basic example

Here is a quick example of a `User` controller containing **2 endpoints**.

```typescript
import { Controller } from 'bridgets';

export class User extends Controller {
  hello = this.createEndpoint({
    method: 'GET',
    handler: () => {
      return 'Hello World';
    },
  });
  bye = this.createEndpoint({
    method: 'GET',
    handler: () => {
      return 'Bye World';
    },
  });
}
```

We use the `this.createEndpoint()` method to create 2 endpoints in the `User` controller. The `handler` is the function that is run when the endpoint is called by a client.

In addition to that, several other things can be configured for each endpoint like the `method`, the `body`, the `middlewares`, the `headers` and the `query`. 

You can find a more detailed explanation of each parameters in the [endpoint documentation](/documentation/endpoints). A more complete example can be found below.

```typescript twoslash
import { z } from 'zod'
import { Controller } from 'bridgets'

export class User extends Controller {
  hello = this.createEndpoint({
    body: z.object({name: z.string(), age: z.number()}),
    headers: z.object({ IP: z.string() }),
    query: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
    middlewares: [authenticationMiddleware], // any middleware that will be executed before the handler
    handler: ({body, query}) => {
      return 'Hello ${body.name}, you are authenticated';
    },
  });
}
```

<Info text="Please note that the 'method' is not specified. By default, each endpoint is a 'POST' request. We strongly encourage you only use 'POST' request as it proposes more data types (dates, numbers) which can't be passed using 'query'." />

### method

The method is the HTTP method that will be used to receive the request. It has to be one of the following: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`. By default, it's value is `POST`.

### body

The `body` is an object that will be validated against the schema defined in the `body` property of the endpoint. This validation is done using the [_zod_](/documentation/validator) module (more validators will be proposed in the next versions).

<Info text="Note that the body DOES NOT work with the GET method." />

```typescript
import { Controller } from 'bridgets';
import { z } from "zod"
// ...
body: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number().min(18).max(124),
})
```

### query

Receive and validate data from the query params sent by the client.

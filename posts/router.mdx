## Basic routing

Create a file called `routes.js` in the `src` directory.

This example is the most basic route possible in Bridge with a basic *Controller*

```typescript
import { Controller, createEndpoint } from 'bridgets';

// type Routes = {[key:string]: Routes | Controller}
export const routes = {
    user: new User(),
}

class User extend Controller {
  // '/user/get'
  get = this.createEndpoint({
    method: 'GET',
    handler: () => {
      return 'Hello World!';
    }
  })
}
```

##### Router + exemple d'arborescence

We export an object *routes* and import it in the file where your express app is. 

We can then use *createExpressMiddleware* from *bridgets* to create a middleware that will handle the routes created by Bridge.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { createExpressMiddleware } from 'bridgets';
// import the routes object from the file where we created the routes
import { routes } from './routes';

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

// We add the routes created to the express app
app.use('/', createExpressMiddleware(routes));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at https://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Nested routes

You can have more complex routing:

```typescript
export const routes = {
    admin: {
      users: new Admin()
    }
}

```

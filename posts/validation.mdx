It is best practice to validate the correctness of any data sent into a web application. To automatically validate incoming requests, Bridge provides support for *zod*, available right out-of-the-box:

These following elements can be validated:
- The `body`
- The `query` 
- `files`

### Query validation

You validate each query sent by the server parameter. 
- Each key of the object has to be a string. 
- **The value has to be a string !**

In other words, it means that only *z.string()* is working for each query validation. If you want to receive and validate other types of data (dates, integers, arrays, etc.), consider using a `POST` request and validate the *body*.

```typescript
import { Controller } from 'bridgets';
import { z } from "zod"

export class User extends Controller {
  get = this.createEndpoint({
    query: z.object({ name: z.string(), age: z.string()}),
    method: 'GET',
    handler: ({ query }) => {
      return `Hello ${query.name} you are ${query.age} years old`;
    },
  });
} 
```

If your app is running on port 8080 and the router correctly links /user to the User controller. You can execute the following HTTP request:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/user/get?name=John&age=20 
```
your will get a response: `Hello John you are 20 years old`

If no queries are specified, an error will be sent to the client detailing the missing elements.

**Request**
```bash
http://localhost:8080/user/get
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "error": {
        "status": 422,
        "name": "The query parameters does not respect the schema.",
        "data": [
            {
                "code": "invalid_type",
                "expected": "string",
                "received": "undefined",
                "path": [
                    "name"
                ],
                "message": "Required"
            },
            {
                "code": "invalid_type",
                "expected": "string",
                "received": "undefined",
                "path": [
                    "age"
                ],
                "message": "Required"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


### Body validation
The body validation works the same way as the query validation. However, you can valide **more complex data structures** such as *arrays* and *objects*. 

Here is a quick example:

```typescript
export class User extends Controller {
  create = this.createEndpoint({
    // method: 'POST' is optionnal because it's the default value
    body: z.object({ 
        name: z.string().min(1).max(99), 
        age: z.number().min(18).max(100), 
        sex: z.string().optional()
        }),
    handler: ({ body }) => {
      return `Hello ${body.name} you are ${body.age} years old`;
    },
  });
} 
```

The **/create** endpoint should receive an object with the following keys:
- `name` : a string with a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 99
- `age` : a number with a minimum value of 18 and a maximum value of 100
- `sex`: an optionnal string

Any invalid request will send an error to the client without being processed by the handler.

The main advantage here is that Typescript knows what the `body` argument contains. With Visual Studio Code, you can hover over the `body` argument and see the type of the argument.
It should be the following:
<Image src="/blog/example-hover.png" description="Interface of 'body'"  style={{width: 250, marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto'}} alt="Interface of 'body'" />

You can now use the power of Typescript to write faster code, knowing what you received from the client.

- method
- body
- query
- headers
- files
- handler

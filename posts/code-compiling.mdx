BridgeTS gives you the ability to automatically generate  the SDK for **any Typescript client**. Its a great way to always have the latest SDKs available and easily use them in your project. It **improves** by a lot the developer experience, reduces friction and makes the code more readable.

Bridge's SDK generation is a simple process that generates a client library for a **Typescript** client.

It can be used with common frontend frameworks such as _React_ _Nextjs_ and _Vue_ as well as with _Angular_ and _Svelte_. The code generated is agnostic of the framework you use as long as it supports **Typescript**.

Thus it can also be used with Backend frameworks like **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

## Requirements
### Working environment

Your app needs to be fully functional which means:

- [Your router](Routing) needs to be configured properly
- Having at least 1 [controller](documentation/controllers)

In addition to that, you have to export the type of the `Routes`.

### Export the type of the Routes

For the types and the SDK to be properly generated, the type you the routes needs to be exported using the `RoutesToSDK` function.

```typescript
import { RoutesToSDK } from 'bridge-ts';
import { User } from "./controllers/User" // Any controller

const routes = {
    user: new User(),
}

export type AnyNameYouWant = RoutesToSDK<typeof routes>;
```

You can find a more detailed example below.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { createExpressMiddleware, RoutesToSDK } from 'bridgets';
import { routes } from './routes';

const app = express();
const port = 8081;

app.use('', createExpressMiddleware(routes));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

export type RouteTypes = RoutesToSDK<typeof routes>;
```

### Create a config file

Create a _bridgets.config.json_ file in your project. It can be located anywhere in your project. Ideally, it should be in the root of your project.

```json file=bridgets.config.json
{
  "tsConfigLocation": "./tsconfig.json",
  "typeLocation": "./src/index.ts",
  "sdkLocation": "./sdk",
  "sdkTypeName": "RouteTypes"
}
```

- `tsConfigLocation`: The location of the tsconfig.json file.
- `typeLocation`: The location of the file exporting the type of the Routes.
- `sdkLocation`: The location where the SDK folder will be generated.
- `sdkTypeName`: The name of the generated folder.

<Structure
  data={[
    {
      type: 'folder',
      label: 'src',
      branches: [
        {
          type: 'folder',
          label: 'controllers',
          branches: [
            {
              type: 'file',
              label: 'user.ts',
              comment: '# Controller',
              branches: [],
            },
          ],
        },
        {
            type: 'file',
            label: 'routes.ts',
            branches: [],
        },
        {
            type: 'file',
            label: 'index.ts',
            comment: '# Your express sever',
            branches: [],
        }
      ],
    },
    {
      type: 'file',
      label: 'package.json',
      branches: [],
    },
    {
      type: 'file',
      label: 'bridgets.config.json',
      comment: '# Configuration file for the bridgets',
      branches: [],
    },
    {
      type: 'file',
      label: 'package-lock.json',
      branches: [],
      comment: 'package-lock.json',
    },
  ]}
/>


### Compiling the code

To compile the code, the project can be launched with -c as argument.

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/index.ts -c
```
You can add that command to your `package.json` file to launch the compilation using `npm run compile`.

```json file=package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx tsc",
    "compile": "npx ts-node ./src/index.ts -c",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon --config nodemon.json ./src/index.ts"
  },
// ...
}

```

### TADA

The SDK can now be downloaded in your client using the `npx bridgets-sdk` command.

```bash
npx bridgets-sdk URL_OF_THE_SERVER
```

<Info text="Note that the server has to be running for the client to download the SDK. If you're running the server on localhost:8080, you can run npx bridgets-sdk localhost:8080" />

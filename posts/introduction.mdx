## Philosphy

In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like Angular, React and Vue, which improve developer productivity and enable the creation of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications.

Typescript gives to Javascript superpowers: it gives you more control, more stability and more predictability code.

### SDK Generation for the client (frontend)

Bridge uses the power of **Typescript** to generate the code of the api. In other words, the backend developers doesn't have to manually write API documentation or to maintain a Postman collection to keep the client up-to-date with the API.

With Bridge, the client knows everything that has to be sent to the server in order to receive the response.

### Strong and stable architecture for backend

In addition to that, Bridge provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, and easily maintainable applications. More info on ([Bridge Architecture](/documentation/code-generation)).

Middleware is a function which is called **before** the route handler. Middleware functions have access to the request object.

Bridgets middleware are, by default, equivalent to express middleware. The following description from the official express documentation describes the capabilities of middlewares:

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request and response objects
- End the request-response cycle.

## Applying middleware

The `createEndpoint` method of a `Controller` takes  `middlewares` as argument. You can pass middleware functions created with `createMiddleware` using `apply`. These functions are called in the order they are passed.

  description="Applying multiplate middlewares"

The middleware fuctions have to return either an `object` or `void`.


```typescript
import { Controller, createMiddleware, apply } from 'bridgets';

const function1 = createMiddleware((req) => {
  console.log('First middleware');
});

const function2 = createMiddleware((req) => {
  console.log('Second middleware');
});

export class ControllerExample extends Controller {
  get = this.createEndpoint({
    middlewares: apply(function1, function2),
    handler: () => {
      console.log('I handle the request...');
      return 'Hello World!';
    },
  });
}
```
The console output would be:
```bash file=console
First middleware
Second middleware
I handle the request
```

## Transfering data

One of the usecases of middlewares is to transfer data **between middlewares** or to **pass data** to the `handler`. 

```typescript
import { Controller, createMiddleware, apply } from 'bridgets';

const function1 = createMiddleware((req) => {
  return { firstName: 'John' };
});

const function2 = createMiddleware((req) => {
  return { lastName: 'Doe' };
});

export class ControllerExample extends Controller {
  endpoint = this.createEndpoint({
    middlewares: apply(function1, function2),
    handler: ({middlewares}) => {
      return `Hello ${middlewares.firstName} ${middlewares.lastName}!`;
    },
  });
}
```
Objects returned by the `createMiddleware` functions are available in the `middlewares` property of the `handler`. Moreover, the interface of the `middlewares` object of the `handler` is **infered** which means that you can benefit from **Typscript validation** and **auto-completion** ! 

<Info text="Please note that returning an object having the same keys with different middlewares would override the value." />

## Returning errors

Middleware are usually used to **return errors** to the client. A typical use case would be an **authentication system** where you would check if the user is authenticated and has the permission to access the endpoint. If not, you would return an error to the client.

Errors can be created with `createHttpError`. Whenever an error is created or thrown with `throw new Error()`, **the request won't be handled** by the endpoint and **won't be passed to the next middleware**.

```typescript
import { Controller, createMiddleware, createHttpError } from 'bridgets';
import { z } from 'zod';

const authenticate = createMiddleware((req) => {
  console.log("Authenticating...");
  if (req.query.name !== 'Dave') {
    return createHttpError('Unauthorized', 'You are not Dave !');
  }
  return { authenticated: true }  as const;
});

export class User extends Controller {
  get = this.createEndpoint({
    query: z.object({name: z.string()}),
    middlewares: [authenticate],
    handler: ({query, middleware}) => {
      console.log("You're authenticated. Hi Dave !");
      console.log(middleware);
      return `Hi Dave`;
    },
  });
}
```

The console output when the right request is made would be:

```bash file=console
Authenticating...
You're authenticated. Hi Dave !
{ middleware: { authenticated: true } }
```

React is famously unopinionated when it comes to file/directory structure. How should you structure the files and directories in your applications?

Well, there is no one “right” way, but I've tried lots of different approaches in the 7+ years I've been using React, and I've iterated my way to a solution I'm really happy with.

In this blog post, I'll share the structure I use across all my current projects, including this blog and my custom course platform.

## Interactive file explorer

Alright, so I'll explain everything in depth, but I thought it'd be fun to let you take a self-guided tour first.

Here's an interactive file explorer. Feel free to poke around and see how things are [structured](https://duckduckgo.com)!

### Example 1

There are all kinds of fun bells and whistles we can add to it:

- Keep track of how many games each player has won
- Enhance the UI with more presentational components
- Allow the board size to be configured (4x4, 5x5)
- Add an AI that the player can play against
- Whimsy! (animations, sound effects, confetti on victory, etc)

Be creative, and pick things you're genuinely interested in!

This strategy is nice because you avoid the stress of a blank canvas. You already have a fully-functional, well-understood project. You're adding bricks to a solid foundation.

It also has a nice side-benefit: if you add significant extensions to a tutorial project, you can take credit for it in your portfolio! I cover this strategy in depth in my book, [Building an Effective Dev Portfolio](https://duckduckgo.com).

Your graph might look a bit different; ultimately, it's up to you to find the right balance! The important thing is that we don't focus exclusively on guided or unguided learning.

## Mindset cultivation

Many years ago, I went bowling with some friends.

I didn't do well. Most of my balls wound up in the gutter. By the end of the game, I had the lowest score out of the group by far.

There are two different ways to interpret this scenario:

```jsx
const Card = ({
  image,
  position,
  prevPosition,
  title,
  description,
  genres,
}) => {
  const genresText = genres.join(', ');
  return (
    <div className="relative h-80 overflow-hidden rounded-md group">
      <img className="inset-0 absolute" src={image} />
      <div
        className="absolute bottom-0 z-0 h-24 w-full"
        style={{
          background:
            'linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(33, 38, 47, 0) 0%, rgba(33, 38, 47, 0.5) 37.35%, rgba(33, 38, 47, 0.8) 100%)',
        }}
      ></div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
